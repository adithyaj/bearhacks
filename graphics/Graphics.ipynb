    "\n",
    "Most modern computers are equippied with video cards that are designed to quickly process projective geometry. Video games and most 3d animations that run on your computer will use this technique. Shapes are represented as 3d triangles, and you must use many (millions) of triangles to make a very nice looking scene. In fact most of the time when you upgrade your video card a common metric is how many triangles per second your card can render.\n",

    "\n",
    "These types of images are generated by shooting a line outward from every pixel in the image. We write code to find what shape that line intersects with, and we use some shading techniques to determine what the color should be. Then we set the color of the pixel that we shot the line out of to that color. We do this for every pixel.\n",
